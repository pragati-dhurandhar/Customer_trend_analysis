# 🛍️ Customer Trend Analysis: End-to-End Data Analytics Portfolio Project
This project demonstrates a complete, industry-standard data analytics workflow. It is designed to showcase my ability to handle raw retail data, perform deep exploratory analysis, and derive actionable insights that help businesses understand customer shopping habits.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade analytics environment by translating raw customer data into strategic business intelligence. I focused on:

Customer Segmentation: Identifying high-value demographics.
Purchasing Patterns: Understanding seasonal trends and category performance.
Operational Efficiency: Analyzing shipping and payment preferences to optimize the customer experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL (PostgreSQL)**
* **Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI**
* **Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git**
* **Concepts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization.**

## 📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python)

Processed raw retail datasets using Pandas to ensure data integrity.
Cleaned null values and standardized categorical fields (e.g., Payment Methods, Categories).

2. Database Schema & Data Loading (SQL)

Established a connection between Python and a SQL Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) using SQLAlchemy.
Schema Design: Defined table structures and data types to host the cleaned data for high-performance querying.
Automated the data migration from a Jupyter environment to a relational database.

3. Advanced SQL Querying

Developed complex SQL scripts to answer critical business questions, such as:
Customer Loyalty: Calculating the Lifetime Value (LTV) of subscribed vs. non-subscribed users.
Market Basket Analysis: Identifying which product categories are frequently bought together.
Regional Performance: Ranking regions by total sales volume and average order value (AOV).

4. Visualization & Business Intelligence (Power BI / Seaborn)

Connected the SQL database to Power BI to build a dynamic dashboard.
Visualized key KPIs like churn rate, seasonal revenue growth, and demographic distribution to provide a 360-degree view of the business.

## 📈 Key Insights Found
* **Demographic Focus: Identified that specific age groups contribute to 60% of the total revenue, suggesting a targeted ad-spend strategy.**
* **Seasonal Trends: Discovered a spike in "Clothing" during Fall/Winter, indicating a need for inventory buildup in Q3.**
* **Loyalty Impact: Quantified the difference in average spend between "Subscribed" and "Non-Subscribed" customers.**
